  "TECHNOLOGY": {
    "TITLE": "BOLT Technology",
    "TITLE1": "Decentralized Audit",
    "DESCRIPTION1": "BOLT has introduced zero-knowledge proof technology, which allows data to be audited without revealing privacy. We believe that the foundation of trust lies in the witnesses, and only when a sufficient number of witnesses are established can the system's credibility be tested. In a fully-functioning society, trust is also inevitably built on mutual supervision among members that is open and transparent. \nAny machine with internet connectivity and a certain amount of storage space can serve as a packaging node for BOLT and receive block rewards. Users can vote for trusted nodes by staking BOLT, and once there are enough trusted nodes, they can sequentially audit the packaged blocks and receive service rewards.",
    "TITLE2": "Zero-Knowledge Proof",
    "DESCRIPTION2": "The essence of zero-knowledge proof is ‘how to prove that one has certain information without revealing the content of that information to others.’ For example, a user needs to prove that they have the password to a safe without revealing any confidential information to a third party. With zero-knowledge proof technology, the user can open the safe and display the unlocked contents as proof of ownership of the password, without disclosing the password to anyone. \nBy integrating this concept with blockchain, BOLT can ensure privacy and security while being monitored by the blockchain ecosystem, without revealing any sensitive information about the enterprise's operations or data. This not only enhances privacy and security but also boosts user trust.",
    "TITLE3": "Hybrid-Chain Evidence",
    "DESCRIPTION3": "Hybrid chain evidence is generated by compressing the off-chain evidence of several transactions into an encrypted hash value, which is then saved on both Ethereum and Bitcoin through cross-chain protocols. It can be used for cross-chain querying, usage, and verification. \nWhen users transfer assets between different blockchains, the unique hash value generated by the hybrid chain proof let both Ethereum and BOLT can verify the transaction, proving that the assets have not been tampered with or double-spending, ensuring the validity and legitimacy of each transaction, and achieving a higher level of data security and correctness."

  "FAQ": {
    "TITLE": "FAQ",
    "QUESTION1": "Why use blockchain ?",
    "ANSWER1_LINE1": "Blockchain, as a distributed database, has brought significant impact to the development of technology today with its decentralization, tamper-proofing, and shared interaction characteristics, and has also pointed to new directions for the development of future technology.",
    "ANSWER1_LINE2": "First of all, blockchain addresses the trust issue of traditional centralized systems and has advantages for applications that require reliable records. For example, blockchain can be used for transaction tracking, asset digitization, and product anti-counterfeiting traceability. With the encryption protection and decentralization features of blockchain, these applications become more fair and transparent, eliminating the possibility of human intervention, ensuring the security and trustworthiness. The potential applications of blockchain are not limited to currency transactions but also have extensive applications in industries such as social media, entertainment, and healthcare.",
    "ANSWER1_LINE3": "Secondly, the development of blockchain will help promote the development of financial technology and digital currencies, improve the efficiency and trustworthiness of transactions, and promote the adoption and popularization of digital currencies, enhancing their liquidity, anonymity, and security. Through tools such as smart contracts, automated contract execution and financial product design can be achieved.",
    "ANSWER1_LINE4": "Finally, the development of blockchain will bring new possibilities for data storage, enabling decentralized storage and exchange of data, combined with zero-knowledge proof technology, thus protecting user data privacy and security. At the same time, it enables data tracing and regulation, improving the transparency and reliability of data management.",
    "ANSWER1_LINE5": "Overall, blockchain brings not only new system design and historical records, but also a whole new form of society. It has been widely used in industries such as finance, e-commerce, and supply chains. The impact of blockchain technology on the current development of technology is profound and it will continue to develop in the future, with an even wider range of applications. It can improve transaction efficiency, reduce costs, enhance data security and privacy protection, and may become an important infrastructure in the future.",
    "QUESTION2": "Why use smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs?",
    "ANSWER2_LINE1": "Smart contracts enable more secure and reliable data storage and exchange. Through smart contracts, trading parties can conduct transactions without the need for third-party intermediaries, reducing costs and risks. Additionally, smart contracts can achieve automation to improve efficiency, transparency, and cost savings. ",
    "ANSWER2_LINE2": "Zero-knowledge proofs, on the other hand, can protect user privacy when conducting transactions on the blockchain, verifying transactions without revealing personal identity or financial information. This ensures transaction security and verifiability, making zero-knowledge proofs particularly important for financial and privacy-sensitive applications. ",
    "ANSWER2_LINE3": "The combination of smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs can be widely used for identity verification, copyright protection, and other scenarios. With security and privacy protection as a prerequisite, they provide more secure, efficient, and reliable solutions for various industries, promoting digital transformation and improving industry efficiency.",
    "QUESTION3": "What are the fields where BOLT can be applied?",
    "ANSWER3_LINE1": "BOLT is designed to effectively connect enterprise centralized systems with public blockchains, allowing businesses to build related applications such as anti-counterfeiting certification of goods, traceability of production and sales links, digital asset management and reserve proof, etc. These fields all require highly trusted data storage and exchange, which is precisely what BOLT is designed to achieve.",
    "ANSWER3_LINE2": "BOLT can help enterprises to put their product production information on the blockchain, providing more trusted product certification information to consumers. Through BOLT Trust service, companies can write product information into the blockchain, ensuring that the product information and production history are tamper-proof. At the same time, the cost of uploading information onto the blockchain has been greatly reduced, providing value to the product without significantly affecting marketing costs. Using BOLT Currency, BOLT can also provide marketing applications for partner factories combined with digital tokens.",
    "ANSWER3_LINE3": "Traceability of Production and Sales: Enterprises can achieve full lifecycle management of products through BOLT. From raw materials to the final sales and usage, all data is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring the quality and safety of products, while also making it convenient for consumers to trace the product's origin.",
    "ANSWER3_LINE4": "Digital Asset Management: BOLT enables enterprises to achieve more secure and reliable digital asset management. Through blockchain technology, enterprises can put digital assets on the chain, ensuring that they are not tampered with or lost. At the same time, BOLT technology also has a reserve proof function, which uses blockchain technology to prove that the enterprise has enough reserves to support its business operations.",
    "ANSWER3_LINE5": "Furthermore, BOLT can also be applied to other fields, including copyright management of digital content and the financial industry. When complete decentralization is not possible, we can solve the problem of information asymmetry between users and intermediaries by providing a high level of global consensus and permanence with mainstream public chains. \nIn summary, BOLT has extensive application prospects in multiple fields, realizing decentralized storage and exchange of data, ensuring the credibility and security of data. It can also help enterprises achieve more efficient and convenient business processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.",
